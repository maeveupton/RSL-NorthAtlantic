# An investigation of ocean dynamics and relative sea-level change in the North Atlantic
We use an extended NI-GAM (Upton et al. 2023) to examine the influence of regional relative sea-level change in the North Atlantic region driven by ocean circulation. We focus on the coastline of North Atlantic, examining the influence of ocean dynamics, termed dynamical sea-level change. In this directory, we used the extended NI-GAM on two separate datasets:
1. East and west sub-regions of the North Atlantic
2. Two sub-regions along the Atlantic coast of North America: north and south of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.
