# An investigation of ocean dynamics and relative sea-level change in the North Atlantic
In this paper, we use an extended NI-GAM (Upton et al. 2023) to examine the influence of regional relative sea-level change in the North Atlantic region driven by ocean circulation. We focus on the coastline of North Atlantic,examining the influence of ocean dynamics, termed dynamical sea-level change.
