# An investigation of ocean dynamics and relative sea-level change in the North Atlantic
In this paper, we use an extended NI-GAM to examine dynamic sea-level change in the North Atlantic region. We focus on regional relative sea-level change for the coastline of the North Atlantic,examining the influence of ocean dynamics on sea-level changes also names as dynamical sea-level change.
